## Hannah Rubin
I am an earth system scientist with a background in GIS, remote sensing, and machine learning. I am passionate about exploring future climate scenarios and applying models to understand climate hazards and the risks to environmental and human health. I recently earned my Ph.D. in environmental engineering from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, where I worked on developing methods of measurement-model to improve projections of climate variables by incorporating machine learning and remote sensing.

### Interests

* environmental applications of GIS 
* earth system science and future climate scenarios
* nitrogen and sulfur deposition modeling 
* measurement model fusion
