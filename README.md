I am a PhD student in environmental engineering at the [University of Tennessee, Knoxville](https://utk.edu/). I graduated from [Dartmouth College](https://home.dartmouth.edu/) in 2020 with a BA in earth science and geography. Check out my research group's [page](http://acs.engr.utk.edu/).

My interests include the environmental applications of GIS and combining in situ measurements with remote sensing to improve climate models.
